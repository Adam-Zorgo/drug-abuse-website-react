# Drug Abuse Prevention Website
by Adam Zorgo + Emad Hassan

## Goals of the Project

* Addictive substances like **drugs** can (and have) become one of the biggest plagues on human life.
* It is important for all of those struggling with an addiction to realize that they **are not alone**.
* Equally as important, is the ability to **notice the early signs** of a drug addiction or the likelyhood of one in the future, after all, an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.
* We combined **all of these critical functionalities** into one project, while also utilizing the knowledge we had gained this semester.
