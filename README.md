# Drug Abuse Prevention Website
by Adam Zorgo + Emad Hassan 

## Goals and Meaning of the Project

* Addictive substances like **drugs** can (and have) become one of the biggest plagues on human life.
* It is important for all of those struggling with an addiction to realize that they **are not alone**.
* Equally as important, is the ability to **notice the early signs** of a drug addiction or the likelyhood of one in the future, after all, an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.
* We combined **all of these critical functionalities** into one project, while also utilizing the knowledge we had gained this semester.

## The Code

#### First are some files that are autogenerated and neccessary for the build

Nonetheless, *ExpressServer.js* is convenient because it holds the entire (albeit small) backend logic.

As can be seen above, the express server takes the number from the file of the risk given, and increments it.


#### Here is where almost the entire relevant codebase lies.

#### Assets merely holds the images and Icons used on the site.

#### GetHelp.js is the script for the Get Help page on the website.

#### Home.js is the home, and main page of the website.

#### MutexRiskCounter.js is our (quite simple) js implementation of a basic mutex lock that we use to update the number values in the text files.

#### Navbar.js was one of the most difficult elements of the website to get working correctly. It implements three reactive links as well as a drawer with similar capabilities.

#### RiskAssessment.js is a very important page as it utilizes the mutex lock, as well as being the most dynamic part of the project.

#### The three txt files are self explanatory.

#### App.css contains all of the __non-inline__ styling.

#### App.js and *index.js* are merely wrappers used for routing.
